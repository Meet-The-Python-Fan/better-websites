# Let's make the web better!

A curated list of awesome resources from around the Internet on Usability, Accessibility, Responsive design and anything related.

This list is built for all you web designers – to help you build a better Internet. An Internet that can be used on mobile over 3G or worse. An Internet that can be used by anyone, regardless of eyesight or other accessibility issues. An Internet that focuses on value instead of pushy popups and sneaky means of stealing your attention. An Internet as it was intended to be used.

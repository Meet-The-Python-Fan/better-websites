# Let's make the web better!

A curated list of awesome resources from around the Internet on Usability, Accessibility, Responsive design and anything related.

This list is built for you all web designers – to help you build a better Internet. A web that can be used on mobile over 3G or worse. A web can be used by anyone, regardless of eyesight. A web that focuses on value instead of pushy popups and other sneaky mean of stealing your attention. A web as it was intended to be used.

Watch the repo to keep posted on all changes and additions to it!
